# Crime_Toronto-Done by Tableau-

The main goal of this report is to provide information to policymakers and practitioners to help them develop strategies to address the nature, extent, and scope of crime and violence. These suggestions are
aimed at the Toronto Police Department and the residents of the country.
To put it another way, preventing a crime is not the responsibility of a single person. It is instead up to society to bear the burden of crime prevention. According to Seneca, a Roman philosopher from the midfirst century AD, "He who does not prevent a crime while he may, encourages it." The major crime indicator dataset includes the occurrences of all crimes reported to the Toronto Police Service for the year 2014 to 2022. The data is at the offence or victim level.
All Major Crime Indicators (MCI) from the original homonymous dataset containing data between the years of 2014 and 2012 by reported date and related offences are highlighted in this study. However, as the most recent linked cases, the research will concentrate on the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.
The significant crime rate occurrence data is used to make assumptions about the types of crimes reported to the Toronto Police between 2019 and 2022.

- The graph above depicts the year-over-year trend in crime.
- The number of offences reported increased from 2017 to 2019 and there has been a sharp decrease in the number of crimes reported in the year 2020.
- For the year 2022, the highest number of offences has been reported.

- The above graph depicts that out of the five primary crime kinds, **Assault** is the crime indicator with the highest percentage of incidence.
- Theft-related crimes are the least common.

Every year, the greatest crime rate is reported, with 2019 being the highest.
• For each year, the highest crime rates occurred on different days.
2022 -Thursday
2021 - Friday
2020 - Wednesday

Assault, which is the most common crime, and Theft Over which is the least common crime occurred the
most in the year 2022.
Breaking and entering occurred mostly in the year 2020.

The lowest crime is reported in the year 2021 in February month and the highest in the year 2019 in July month.

**Factors influence the crime**
Victims of crime share many of the same social features as criminals. According to the General Social Survey (GSS) of 1999, young individuals aged 15 to 24 in Canada had the highest rates of violent and property offenses.The GSS also discovered that personal victimization rates were highest in metropolitan areas, among single people, and those living in low-income households. Mata (2003) discovered that greater rates of crime were associated with the presence of at-risk groups such as Aboriginals, women, and lone parents in his analysis of Canada's 24 major cities. However, research has indicated that rates of victimization in Canada are higher for households with higher earnings when it comes to property crimes including break and enter, auto theft, and vandalism.

**Some of the Factors that can be addressed are as below**

**• Poverty Level and Job Availability**
Poverty and crime go hand in hand, according to statistics. When poverty is predominant in a place, that community will have greater crime rates. There are several risk variables that are unique to juvenile crime. Children growing up in impoverished communities are frequently exposed to violence and drug misuse at a young age. Another significant risk factor is getting into "the wrong crowd," as well as having ready access to weaponry. Family violence, as well as broken or unstable homes, can be among the most dangerous risk factors for adolescent offenders. Another big risk factor is the everyday media effect that practically every child in the country is exposed to.

**• Social Level of Morality**
Deviant behavior is allowed and encouraged in some families and communities. Even minor violations are reported and corrected in other places. According to studies, those who were physically, sexually, or emotionally abused as children are three times more likely to commit acts of violence as adults than nonabused adults. A person may commit a crime solely to fit in with his friends in a community where crime is tolerated.

**• Police Policy**
A well-resourced police force, combined with harsh penalties for criminals, may help to lower crime rates.

**• Age of the Population**

There is a link between the crime rate and the population's age. Most crimes are committed by people in their teens, twenties, and thirties, especially in places with a young and transient population. Violence is a young man's crime; it has been argued that a 30th birthday is the most effective law enforcement tool.

**Initiatives that are made to reduce the risk of violence.**

**Youth Opportunity Initiatives: Training**
The Community Crisis Response Program — A coordinated program of city agencies (including the Toronto Police Service, Toronto Community Housing, and community groups) that provides support to neighborhoods in the aftermath of "trauma-producing events," such as murders and violent assaults. Staff from the program collaborate with residents and community organizations to find and implement culturally relevant treatments and support to aid in the recovery process.
Other projects under Toronto's Community Safety Plan include those targeted at identifying 'at risk' areas inside those neighborhoods, in addition to identifying thirteen "at-risk" neighborhoods and working to establish specialized social prevention techniques. This is performed through a safety audit, a "community action tool" meant to address public safety issues, with a special focus on women, children, and marginalized groups who are the most vulnerable to violence.
The Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS), a plan that is part of a package of anti-violence activities administered by the TPS's Community Mobilization Unit and sponsored by the provincial government,
was born out of those meetings. TAVIS is an area-based, targeted approach to addressing violent crime in the neighborhoods where it tends to occur, like the programs and activities that make up the City's Community
Safety Plan. TAVIS, on the other hand, is meant to be a target-specific, risk-focused effort that combines intelligence from specialized units like the Drug Squad and the Gun and Gang Task Force with 'on the ground'
information obtained by local officers and divisional Community Response Units.

**Summary**

From the years 2019 through 2022, the highest crime rate was reported in 2022, while the lowest crime rate was observed in 2020. In both 2019 and 2021, most crimes were discovered to occur on Friday. Wednesdays will be the most crime-ridden day in 2020. Break and enter, auto theft, robbery, and theft over are the most common types of crimes. Educational institutions are the safest places to be, having the lowest crime rates. Most crimes are committed in the apartment. Considering the current covid epidemic, lockdown may be one of the factors contributing to a lower crime rate in 2020.
When it comes to reducing crime, there are several factors to consider, including poverty, morality, job availability, police policy, and population age. According to studies, there are a variety of reasons that contribute to the rise and fall of crime in our society
